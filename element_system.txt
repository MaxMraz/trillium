Element System

Fire:
Fire is a short-lived entity that will damage the hero and can have a couple effects when colliding with another entity.

If the other entity has a method `entity:react_to_fire()`, that method will be called.

Otherwise, if `other_entity.can_burn` is true, or if `other_entity:get_property("can_burn")` is true, then the other entity will be destoryed after a moment and more fire will spread from that point.

Requires several map methods to be defined:
`map:create_fire(props)` takes a table with x, y, and layer and creates and returns the fire entity
`map:propagate_fire(x,y,z)` creates more fire at this position and spreads it out.
